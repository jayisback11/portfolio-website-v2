# <strong>Portfolio Website 2</strong> 

**Version 1.0.0** 

## **Description**
My first portfolio website was not good enough because it lacks animations and it doesn't show what I know.  
  
The purpose of this new portfolio website is to show what I've learned. This includes:
- Responsive Web Design
- Website Load Speed
- Outstanding Web Design
